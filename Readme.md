Aproach:
I used the plant.id API to create this web app. I generated an Api Key from the official page of plant.id. After generating the key. I used that in script.js file to fetch the data after getting image file as input. This Api is specially used for fetching the informations of the plants. I had to do some research before doing this , tried some other API as well but those did not work out.
